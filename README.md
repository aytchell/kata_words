# Word Puzzles

## Task 1 - Palindrome

Create a program/method/function, which takes as input a word and checks if
the word is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or
other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such
as `madam` or `racecar` or the number `10801`.

## Task 2 - Anagrams

Create a program/method/function, which takes as input two words and checks
if these two words are anagramms. An anagram is a word formed by rearranging
the letters of a different word, by using all the original letters exactly
once.

Example: `listen <-> silent`
